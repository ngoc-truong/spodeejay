# Spodeejay

Spodeejay is an app to sort your music from Spotify. With Spodeejay you can sort your music in an ascending/descending order until it reaches a 
threshold value entered by the user. Therefore the speed will change slowly until it reaches the threshold.

This is especially useful to get faster (or slower) step by step in your playlist.
